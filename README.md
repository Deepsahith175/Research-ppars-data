# ArXiv Data Scraping

This repository contains a Python-based data scraping tool designed to collect and store research data from **arXiv** and **MDPI**. The scraped data is saved in an Excel file for easy access and further analysis.

## Overview

The code implements web scraping techniques to extract research papers, including titles, authors,category, abstracts and publication dates,from **arXiv**  The collected data is then stored in an Excel file for convenient sharing and referencing.

## Implementation

The scraping tool uses Python libraries such as:
- `requests` for making HTTP requests
- `BeautifulSoup` for parsing HTML content
- `pandas` for data manipulation and Excel file creation
